# Project: Popcorn Predictors - Movie Recommendation System
## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and movie attributes. The primary objective was to explore and compare different recommendation approaches to create an effective recommendation engine using the data analytics skills and machine learning techniques learned throughout this bootcamp.

**Bootcamp:** NYU Tandon Data Science Bootcamp Spring 2025

## Background
Recommendation systems have become an integral part of how we discover and enjoy content, from music to products and services. They help personalize the user experience by suggesting items that match individual preferences. Key approaches include:
- **Demographic Filtering:** technique that uses user demographic data (gender, age, location) to suggest items or content that are likely to be relevant to users with similar characteristics
- **Content-Based Filtering:** technique that suggests items to a user based on their past interactions and preferences (genres, director, keywords, ratings, purchases), using item features to find similar items
- **Collaborative Filtering:** technique that predicts user preferences by analyzing the behaviors and preferences (correlation) of similar users or items
  
## Research Objectives
- Design and implement multiple recommendation system approaches for movie suggestions
- Compare the effectiveness of demographic, content-based, and collaborative filtering techniques
- Evaluate recommendation quality using standard machine learning metrics
- Analyze patterns in user preferences and movie popularity trends
- Create visualizations to showcase recommendation performance and insights 

## Methods and Analytical Pipeline
1. **Dataset Exploration:** TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset analysis and structure examination
2. **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate entries
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and transforming movie metadata for model input
4. **Model Development:** Implementing and training multiple recommendation algorithms
5. **Evaluation:** Performance assessment using precision, recall, F1-score, and MAP entries
