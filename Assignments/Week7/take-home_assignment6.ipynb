    "1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assess if an insight is statistically significant by performing statisical hypothesis testing. With this, we are asking how possible it is for the insight to be true if we assume that the null hypothesis is also true, using the p-value as a basis for our measurement. If the p-value is less than the condidence level (usually 5%), then we reject our null hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Statistical power is the probability/likelihood, usually set to 80%, that a statistical test will correctly identify an effect if there actually is one to detect. This is used to prevent not rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect when it is actually false. The higher the statistical power, the less chance there is to make this error.\n",

This is done by using null hypothesis significance testing, which aims to counteract the human tendency to look for convenient evidence to their bias.\n",

    "Confounding variables are outside influences on both the cause and effect in a study's experiment. They are correlated with the independent variable, and are causally related to the dependent variable. These variables must be accounted for in research to avoid bais, as they could influence the actual relationship between the variables that the research is targetting.\n",

The test compares the alteration of only one variable, and randomly assigns a version to the testing group. Statistical analysis is then performed on the collected results to determine if the alteration was a positive or negative change, or had neutral effects. \n",
