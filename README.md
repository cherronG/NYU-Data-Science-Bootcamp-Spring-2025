# NYU-Data-Science-Bootcamp Spring 2025
This is a repository documenting my experience at NYU Tandon's Data Science Bootcamp, containing all take-home assignments, my portion of the project data analysis, and project presentations.

## Bootcamp Description
The NYU Tandon Data Science Bootcamp is designed to support NYU Tandon students in developing the skills and confident needed for technical interviews, focusing on data science concepts and problem-solving techniques.

Participants accepted into the program engage in a collaborative, instructor-guided learning environment, with weekly assignments, live sessions, and a culminating team project. The bootcamp also offers students the chance to showcase their final projects to industry professionals and compete for recognition and awards.
